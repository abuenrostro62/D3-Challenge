# D3-Challenge
This project focuses on an analysis of Healthcare vs. Poverty and Smokers vs. Age. The dataset was retrieved from the 2014 U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

Using D3, a scatter plot between two of the data variables, Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age was created to visualized trends and patterns. In the scatter plot, each state abbreviation is represented with circle elements. 

Code for this graphic was in an app.js file and data was pulled from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. Python -m http.server was used to run the visualization. This hosted the page at localhost:8000 in my web browser.

Here is an image of the scatter plot.
